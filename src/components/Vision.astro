        You wake to birdsong filtering through jungle canopy. The air is warm, thick
        with salt and green. Your morning ritual: coffee on the terrace, a quick
        check of the surf from above, then barefoot down the path to the water.
      </p>

      <p>
        By midmorning you are back at the compound. Your partners are on calls in
        one building while the kitchen team preps lunch in another. A visiting
        artist works in the studio space. Someone is hosting a small group for
        breathwork in the garden.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lunch is communal, always. Long table, mismatched chairs, the kind of meal
        that stretches into the afternoon because the conversation is too good to leave.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a retreat center, though it could be one. It is not a hotel,
        though you could run one. It is not a commune, though community forms
        naturally here. It is a platform: a collection of spaces ready to hold
        whatever vision you bring.
      </p>

      <p class="vision-tagline">
        Build the village. Surf every morning. Host the future.

        <h3>Real Assets in a Digital Age</h3>
        <p>
          Land does not disappear. Buildings hold value through cycles. In a world
          of uncertain digital assets and volatile markets, a tangible compound on
          a desirable island offers something different: real square meters, real
          structures, real potential.

        <h3>Growing Global Interest</h3>
        <p>
          Florianopolis has been called the "Silicon Valley of Brazil" for its growing
          tech scene. International arrivals are increasing. The island draws remote
          workers, digital nomads, and investors seeking quality of life paired with
          opportunity. Demand trends have been positive, though past performance is
          not a guarantee of future results.
        </p>

      <div class="investment-block">
        <h3>Multiple Revenue Possibilities</h3>
        <p>
          The property's structure offers optionality. Run it as a hospitality business
          and generate income. Use part while renting part. Develop the buildable area
          over time. The diversity of structures creates flexibility that a single
          building cannot match.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="investment-block">
        <h3>Currency Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          The Brazilian Real has historically traded at levels that can favor
          foreign buyers. Exchange rates fluctuate and should be factored into your
          analysis. This is context, not advice.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="investment-block">
        <h3>Exit Optionality</h3>
        <p>
          Properties with multiple structures can be subdivided or sold as a whole.
          The hospitality track record (if you build one) can make the asset more
          attractive to future buyers. Flexibility in how you exit is built into
          the asset.
